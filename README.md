Birthday Surprise — scaffold

What I added:
- `index.html` — mobile-first single page
- `styles.css` — light/white theme, typewriter styles, slideshow placeholder
- `script.js` — countdown to Jan 16 00:00 (2026), reveal, typewriter effect for the paragraph, simple slideshow and audio controls
- `assets/images/` — folder for your photos (replace placeholder1.jpg etc)
- `assets/audio/` — folder for the song (replace song.mp3)

How to preview locally:
1. Open `d:\Birthday\surprise\index.html` in your browser (double-click or drag into browser).
2. Replace images in `assets/images/` with your photos (use same names or update `script.js`).
3. Add your song at `assets/audio/song.mp3`.

Notes & next steps:
- I used a mobile-first layout and set the countdown target to Jan 16 00:00 local time (2026).
- If you want a different tone/message, tell me and I will draft a heartfelt paragraph to replace the placeholder in `index.html`.
- I can add animations (floating hearts), a photo grid, or an embedded video message if you want.

I'll continue with polishing after you confirm the visuals and the message you want included.
